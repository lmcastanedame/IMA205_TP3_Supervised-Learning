# Introduction to Supervised Learning - IMA205

This repository contains instructional materials for the IMA205 Introduction to Supervised Learning course, taught by Pietro Gori. Included are theoretical questions and practical exercises related to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net regularization, as well as their applications in supervised machine learning.

## Content Overview

- `TP_Intro_Supervised.pdf`: Theoretical background and exercises on OLS, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net.
- `TP_IntroSupervised_MachineLearning_0part_toy_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with a toy classification problem to apply the concepts learned.
- `TP_IntroSupervised_MachineLearning_1part_FEI.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook focusing on a real-world application using the FEI face dataset.

## Theoretical Questions and Exercises

The PDF document provides a detailed explanation of different regression techniques, along with questions that challenge the reader to deepen their understanding:

- Demonstrate why OLS provides the estimator with the smallest variance.
- Show that the estimator of ridge regression is biased.
- Solve for the ridge regression estimator using SVD decomposition.
- Analyze the effects of varying Î» on bias and variance in ridge regression.
- Compute solutions for Elastic Net regularization and discuss its advantages.

## Practical Application

The Jupyter notebooks contain code snippets and exercises to implement and visualize the effects of these regression techniques:

- **Toy Classification**: A simple classification problem to illustrate the application of OLS and regularization methods.
- **FEI Face Dataset**: Application of supervised learning methods to a real dataset, providing a more in-depth understanding of the concepts.
